# OurChan Forum
## Motivation: Fuck Jannies

This is a fork of 4chan, rebuilt on-top of nostr. WORK-IN-PROGRESS code is messy<br/>
To steal fiatjaf's words: 'a truly censorship-resistant alternative to [4chan] that actually has a chance of working' <br/>
Read [here](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) if you're new to the nostr protocol.<br/><br/>

This OurChan repo is just a client, the boards/threads themselves are detached from anything here.
The intention is that many people run their own instances, which can be different, but follow a general standard to ensure boards/threads are kept intact and usable.
If OurChan sees any meaningful use, these standards should be outlined like NIPs.

OurChan should keep the important properties and structures used on 4chan <br/>
-Posts are mostly anonymous <br/>
-Contextual thread view <br/>
-Boards to segregate topics of discussion
